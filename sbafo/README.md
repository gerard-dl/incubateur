## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a small library enabling developers to build *backoffice applications* in a very fast way.  
The main idea behind this is that in my career I found that usually in a *backoffice app* there are a lot of repetitive behaviour for the most part of the application and only a small part requires a custom "approach".  
The "repetitive behaviour" often is based on the hated [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) functions.  
So I think that mixing something able to handle those "repetitive behaviour", with something else specifically built for a custom use case, could heavily improve the development of your *backoffice*.
