# command-to-rest

An experiment where some commands (I used the `Consumer` class because it is similar to a `Command` and allows to fast usage in Java) can be exposed via REST api.
Probably it is better to call this in a different way 'cause for example the `GET` is mapped to a `Function` instead a `Consumer`.

## Project creation

The project has been created using https://start.spring.io/ adding just Spring Web and Lombok.
