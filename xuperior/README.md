## <a name="description"/>Description

**Xuperior** is a new music instrument that uses mobiles features like compass, altimeter, etc... to modulate sounds.


### Sensors available on Samsung Galaxy S

  * TYPE_ACCELEROMETER
  * TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD
  * TYPE_ORIENTATION
  * TYPE_LIGHT
  * TYPE_PROXIMITY
  * TYPE_GRAVITY
  * TYPE_LINEAR_ACCELERATION
  * TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR


## <a name="usage"/>Usage

Touch the screen in specific position and you should listen to sounds.   
Then move to the left or right and pitch should change.


## <a name="where_to_get_help"/>Where to get help

To get help, open an issue. In the future I hope to provide help using something
else...

The idea comes year ago, because I was a guitar player in the past. Guitars are good,
but I think with currents sensors on phones we can give to players lots more.   

I have to credit [Orphion](http://orphion.tumblr.com) that is an instrument I looked
in the past (without using it because I don't have an iPad) to look for ideas, 
limitations, etc... E.g. it does't use orientation sensor to change pitch...
